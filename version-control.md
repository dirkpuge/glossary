# Version Control

Version control systems are a category of software tools that help a software team manage changes to source code over time. Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.

## Branch

A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is master (disputed). As you start making commits, you're given a master (disputed) branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, the master (disputed) branch pointer moves forward automatically.

## Commit

Commits are created with the git commit command to capture the state of a project at that point in time.

## Git

Git is a distributed version control system. Every dev has a working copy of the code and full change history on their local machine, by Linus Torvalds.

## Mercurial

Mercurial is a distributed source control management tool, now outdated.
