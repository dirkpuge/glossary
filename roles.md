## Titles

### Support Engineer/Support Agent

A support engineer serves as an expert (not necessarily) in the products that their company builds. They find solutions to problems and help customers work through their technical difficulties.

### Front-end Developer/Engineer

A front-end engineer, also web developer or web designer, selects the tools, builds and tests the **[user interface](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/misc.md#user-interface)** elements of a website. They are responsible for implementing visual elements that the users see and interact with in a **[web app](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/misc.md#web-app)**.

### Back-end Developer/Engineer

A back-end engineer, also referred to as X engineer for whichever component they are working on (i.e. CI/CD back-end engineer could be a Build Engineer) work on the **[server](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/hardware.md#server)** components of **[web apps](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/misc.md#web-app)**. They focus on **[web services](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/misc.md#web-services)** and the **[data store](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/misc.md#data-store)** (data modelling and **[databases](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/misc.md#databases)**). They may also be involved with **[business rule implementation logic](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/misc.md#business-rule-implementation-logic)**. Basically, they are responsible for implementing what you do not see in a **[web app](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/misc.md#web-app)**.

### Full-stack Developer/Engineer

A full-stack engineer is a web developer who works with both the front-end and back-end of an application. Kind of a hybrid between front-end and back-end engineer.

### iOS Developer/Engineer

An iOS engineer is responsible for developing applications for **[mobile devices](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/hardware.md#mobile-devices)** powered by Apple's **[iOS operating system](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/os.md#ios)**. Typically this means being the front-end and back-end engineer for the iOS platform.

### Android Developer/Engineer

Typically this means being the front-end and back-end engineer for the Android platform.

### UI Developer/Engineer

The main goals are to create **[scalable](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/misc.md#scalable-software-systems)** and highly **[reliable](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/misc.md#reliable-software-systems)** software systems.

### Data Engineer

A data engineer builds **[pipelines](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/misc.md#data-pipelines)** that prepare and **[transform data](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/misc.md#transform-data)** for data scientists.
