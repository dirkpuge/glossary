## JavaScript (Node.js)

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. While JavaScript can be used with other runtime environments such as Deno (an up and coming runtime environment), it is not widely adopted and JavaScript *usually* comes with Node.js.
