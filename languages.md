# Languages

## Bash

Bash is a **[Unix](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/os.md#unix)** **[shell](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/os.md#shell)** and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the **[Bourne shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell)** (outdated).

## Bytecode

Unlike human-readable source code, bytecodes are compact numeric codes, constants, and references (normally numeric addresses) that encode the result of compiler parsing and performing semantic analysis of things like type, scope, and nesting depths of program objects.

## Compiled Programming Language

A compiled language is a programming language whose implementations are typically compilers, and not interpreters.

## Concurrent/Concurrency

A concurrent program is one defining actions that may be performed simultaneously.

## Dart

Dart is a client-optimized programming language for apps on multiple platforms. Used for **[Flutter](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/frameworks.md#flutter)**.

## Data Serialization Language

Data serialization is the process of converting data objects present in complex data structures into a byte stream for storage, transfer and distribution purposes.

## Elixir (Erlang)

Elixir is a **functional**, **concurrent**, general-purpose programming language that runs on the Erlang **[virtual machine](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/os.md#virtual-machine)**.

## Functional Programming Language

A functional programming language is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.

## Go

Go is a **[statically typed](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/languages.md#statically-typed)**, **compiled programming language** designed at Google.

## High-level programming language

A high-level programming language is a programming language with strong abstraction from the details of the computer.

## HTML/CSS

HTML (the Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two of the core technologies for building Web pages.

## Interpreted

An interpreted language is a type of programming language for which most of its implementations execute instructions directly and freely, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions.

## Java

Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995.

## JavaScript (Node.js)

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the **[ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript)** specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

Node.js is an **[open-source](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/misc.md#open-source)**, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. While JavaScript can be used with other runtime environments such as **[Deno](https://deno.land/)** (an up and coming runtime environment), it is not widely adopted and JavaScript *usually* comes with Node.js.

## JVM

A Java virtual machine is a **[virtual machine](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/os.md#virtual-machine)** that enables a computer to run Java programs as well as programs written in other languages that are also compiled to Java **bytecode**.

## Kotlin

Kotlin is a cross-platform, **statically typed**, general-purpose programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the **JVM** version of its standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its **[syntax](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/languages.md#syntax)** to be more concise.

## Low-level programming language

A low-level programming language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's **[instruction set](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/hardware.md#instruction-set)** **[architecture](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/hardware.md#architecture)**.

## Multi-paradigm

Multi-paradigm programming languages can be object-oriented and functional depending on how projects are written.

## Objective-C

Objective-C is a general-purpose, **object-oriented** programming language that adds Smalltalk-style messaging to the C programming language.

## Object-oriented

Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures. Opposed to **functional programming**.

## Python

Python is an **interpreted**, **high-level**, general-purpose programming language.

## Ruby

Ruby is an **interpreted**, **high-level**, general-purpose programming language.

## Rust

Rust is a **multi-paradigm** programming language focused on performance and safety, especially safe **concurrency**.

## Statically Typed

A language is statically-typed if the type of a variable is known at compile-time instead of at run-time.

## Swift

Swift is a general-purpose, **multi-paradigm**, **compiled** programming language developed by Apple.

## Syntax

Each programming language has its own syntax or "grammar" for defining code. The syntax of a computer language is the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be a correctly structured document or fragment in that language

## Typescript

TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft.
