# Languages

## Bash

Bash is a **Unix** **shell** and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the **Bourne shell**.

## Dart

Dart is a client-optimized programming language for apps on multiple platforms. Used for **Flutter**.

## Elixir (Erlang)

Elixir is a **functional**, **concurrent**, general-purpose programming language that runs on the Erlang **virtual machine**.

## Go

Go is a **statically** typed, **compiled programming language** designed at Google.

## HTML/CSS

HTML (the Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two of the core technologies for building Web pages.

## Java

Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995.

## JavaScript (Node.js)

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. While JavaScript can be used with other runtime environments such as Deno (an up and coming runtime environment), it is not widely adopted and JavaScript *usually* comes with Node.js.

## Kotlin

Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of its standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise.

## Objective-C

Objective-C is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that adds Smalltalk-style messaging to the C programming language.

## Python

Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.

## Ruby

Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.

## Rust

Rust is a multi-paradigm programming language focused on performance and safety, especially safe concurrency.

## Swift

Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple.

## Syntax

Each programming language has its own syntax or "grammar" for defining code. The syntax of a computer language is the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be a correctly structured document or fragment in that language

## Typescript

TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft.
