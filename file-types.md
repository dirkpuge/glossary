# File Types

## CSV

A comma-separated values file is a delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values. Each line of the file is a data record. Each record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas. The use of the comma as a field separator is the source of the name for this file format.

## JSON

JavaScript Object Notation or JSON is an open standard file format, and data interchange format, that uses human-readable **[data-serialization language](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/languages.md#data-serialization-language)** to store and transmit data objects consisting of attribute-value pairs and array data types.

## TOML

TOML is a file format for **[configuration files](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/misc.md#configuration-file)**. It is intended to be easy to read and write due to obvious semantics which aim to be "minimal", and is designed to map unambiguously to a dictionary. Its specification is **[open-source](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/misc.md#open-source)**.

## YAML

YAML is a human-readable **[data-serialization language](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/languages.md#data-serialization-language)**. It is commonly used for **[configuration files](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/misc.md#configuration-file)** and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted.
