## Operating Systems

## Android

Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the **[Linux kernel](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/os.md#linux-kernel)** and other **[open-source](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/misc.md#open-source)** software.

## Darwin

Darwin is an **[open-source](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/misc.md#open-source)** **[Unix-like](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/os.md#unix-like)** operating system.

## Debian

Debian, also known as Debian GNU/Linux, is a Linux distribution composed of free and open-source software.

## Distribution

A Linux distribution (often abbreviated as distro) is an operating system made from a software collection that is based upon the **[Linux kernel](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/os.md#linux-kernel)** and, often, a **[package management system](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/os.md#package-manager)**.

## Dual Booting

The process of accessing two operating systems on a single computer.

## Hypervisor

A hypervisor is a process that separates a computer's operating system and applications from the underlying physical hardware.

## iOS 

iOS is a mobile operating system created and developed by Apple Inc. exclusively for its hardware.

## Linux

Linux is a family of open source **[Unix-like](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/os.md#unix-like)** operating systems based on the **[Linux kernel](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/os.md#linux-kernel)**.

## Linux kernel

The Linux kernel is the main component of a Linux operating system and is the core interface between a computer's hardware and its **[processes](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/hardware.md#processes)**.

## macOS

macOS is a series of proprietary graphical operating systems developed and marketed by Apple, based on **[Darwin](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/os.md#darwin)**.

## Memory Model

A memory model describes the interactions of threads through memory and their shared use of the data.

## Operating System

An operating system is the software that supports a computer's basic functions, such as **[scheduling tasks](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/os.md#scheduling-tasks)**, executing applications, and controlling peripherals.

## Package Manager

A package manager or package-management system is a collection of software tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing computer programs for a computer's operating system in a consistent manner.

## Scheduling Tasks

Also known as a scheduler. It selects processes from the queue and loads them into memory for execution. Process loads into the memory for CPU scheduling. The primary objective of the job scheduler is to provide a balanced mix of jobs, such as **[I/O](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/hardware.md#io)** bound and processor bound. It also controls the degree of multiprogramming.

## Shell

A shell is a user interface for access to an operating system's services. In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface (CLI)

## Ubuntu

Ubuntu is a **[Linux distribution](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/os.md#distribution)** based on **[Debian](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/os.md#debian)** mostly composed of free and **[open-source](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/misc.md#open-source)** software.

## Unix

Unix is a family of **multitasking**, **multiuser** operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix, development starting in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others.

## Unix-like

A Unix-like operating system is one that behaves in a manner similar to a **Unix** system, while not necessarily conforming to or being certified to any version of the **[Single UNIX Specification](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/)**.

## Virtual Machine

A virtual machine is an **[emulation](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/misc.md#emulation)** of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on **[computer architectures](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/hardware.md#architecture)** and provide functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination.

## Windows

Windows is a series of **[operating systems](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/os.md#operating-system)** produced by Microsoft and released as part of its Windows NT family of operating systems.

## Windows NT

Windows NT is a family of **[operating systems](https://github.com/non-binary/glossary/blob/main/os.md#operating-system)** produced by Microsoft, the first version of which was released on July 27, 1993. It is a processor-independent, multiprocessing and multi-user operating system.
