# Hardware

## Architecture

The **CPU** architecture defines the basic **instruction** set, as well as the exception and **memory models** that are relied upon by the **operating system** and **hypervisor**.

## ARM

ARM is a family of reduced **instruction set** computing (**RISC**) **architectures** for computer processors, configured for various environments.

## CPU

CPUs, or Central Processing Units, are responsible for processing and executing instructions.

## I/O

Any movement of data between **disk** and **memory**.

## Instruction Set

An instruction set architecture (ISA) is an abstract model of a computer.

## Memory

Random access memory (RAM) also known as memory is essentially your device’s short-term memory. It temporarily stores (remembers) everything that runs on your PC, like all the services in Windows, your web browser, your image editing tool, or the game you’re playing. You don’t want the CPU digging through your slower storage, like a hard drive or even a solid-state drive (SSD), every time you request a new browser tab or load a new enemy to shoot. As fast as storage is compared to drives of years gone by, they’re still far slower than RAM.

## Mobile Devices

Mobile devices are portable and typically run on **ARM processors**.

## RISC

A reduced instruction set computer, or RISC, is a computer instruction set that allows a computer's microprocessor to have fewer cycles per instruction (CPI) than a complex instruction set computer (CISC).

## Server

A server is a computer that is dedicated to managing network resources.

## Storage

Storage also known as long term storage is where your pictures, documents and applications are stored.

## x86

x86 is a family of **instruction set** **architectures** initially developed by Intel based on the Intel 8086 microprocessor. The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address.
